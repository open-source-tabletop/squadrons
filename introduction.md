# Squadrons

---

In Squadrons, each player commands around 5 to 15 ships which they will use to outmanoeuvre and outwit their opponents in a game of high speed space combat. Squadrons uses the [Cadence core rules](../core-rules/introduction.md) with some additional rules provided in the following sections.

Each model in Squadrons represents a single ship of fighter or bomber scale referred to throughout as **ships**, all ships count as having the **Vehicle** special rule. You may use any models you find appropriate so long as the scale and bases are consistent between players, though ships that fit on 40-50mm bases are typical. Larger ships may require a larger space to play the game.
