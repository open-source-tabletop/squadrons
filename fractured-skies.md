# Fractured Skies

Fractured Skies is a custom fleet list for the game Squadrons. It provides multiple aircraft profiles for the various factions found in the game Fracture. These ships do not use the ship building rules found in Squadrons and are not designed to be used alongside them.

## Sentinel Fleets

Much like their ground forces, Sentinel ships are tough and well armed, with elite battle-hardened pilots. Even their smallest strike fighters are able to threaten the larger ships of enemy fleets while few can match the firepower of their heavy bombers.
