# Building a Squadron

---

Building a squadron can be done in 2 ways: creating custom ships as outlined below or using premade fleet lists that used the rules below - these are found in the Fleets section of this game. Each ship has an associated points cost and players select up to 15 ships to a total of 300 points. Larger games can be played at 400 points or more but may require a larger battlefield area.

## Custom Ships

Players build their squadron by creating ships as outlined below. Each ship has a basic profile that is then enhanced by a number of upgrades.

Each ship starts at a cost of 15 points, with each upgrade and weapon adding to this total. Any ship with 5 or more upgrades adds 10 points and any ship with 7 or more adds 15 points. One ship should be designated as your Squadron Leader and gains the Squadron Leader special rule.
