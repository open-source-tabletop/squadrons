# Squadrons

Squadrons is a game of high speed combat between small fighter or bomber scale ships. Each player commands a squadron of around 5 to 15 ships as they try to take down their opponents ships.





## Playing Squadrons

Squadrons uses the **Cadence Wargame System** core rules, which can be found at [Cadence.Games](https://cadence.games).

Each model in Squadrons represents a single ship of fighter or bomber scale referred to throughout as **ships**, all ships count as having the **Vehicle** special rule. You may use any models you find appropriate so long as the scale and bases are consistent between players, though 1/270 scale is recommended.

Squadrons is best played on a **3ft x 3ft** or similar sized area and each game lasts for **4 rounds**.

### Ship Movement

Each time you activate one of your ships you must always take a Move action, though you may still choose when to perform this action. When you perform this action or and Advance action you must also move the maximum distance allowed and may only make 1 pivot per action.

When you make an Advance action you may instead move 2 inches forward and pivot your ship exactly 180 degrees.

You may move over the bases of any friendly or enemy ships during your movement so long as you have sufficient movement to complete the move without the bases overlapping. If you do not have sufficient movement your ship stops before passing over the enemy base and your activation ends.

#### Evasion

When a ship is targeted for an attack it may try to evade the attack if it still has Command Points remaining. This must be declared before any dice are rolled for the attack and the attacking player must give sufficient time for the player to declare they are evading. Spend one Command Point and move this ship up to 2 inches directly to the left or right of its forward direction, stopping if it would overlap another ship's base. This ship may re-roll any failed Defence and Counter rolls from the attack that targetted it. 

### Ship Attacks

Ships may only target enemy ships that are over an inch away but otherwise may choose any enemy ship as a target.

Line of sight in Squadrons is always worked out on the flat surface of the battlefield using only the ships bases to determine the results.These lines are treated the same as the sight lines you would use when looking through a model.

### Terrain

Terrain plays a limited roll in Squadrons and is not needed for every game, however it can add some interest to have some small items such as asteroids, debris, or other such items. All terrain in Squadrons is required to have a suitable base or footprint to determine line of sight through it.

There are two types of terrain available in Squadrons: Obscuring and Dangerous. Ships may move freely across this terrain with the following additional rules.

#### Obscuring

Obscuring terrain typically represents gas clouds or other phenomena that obscures vision. Ships cannot target an enemy ship if any line of sight can be drawn between them that passes through Obscuring terrain.

#### Dangerous

Dangerous terrain represents solid objects such as asteroids or debris fields which a ship must be careful to avoid. Ships may move through dangerous terrain, the model is often just a representation of multiple objects, however any ship that spend any part of their activation within Dangerous terrain must roll a d6 at the end of their activation, on a roll of a 4+ they take 1 hit with a Damage of 5 and must roll to Counter it as normal.

### Objectives

Squadrons has three types of objectives: **Scan**, **Recover**, and **Destroy**.

- **Scan**: Scan objectives require a ship to make a close pass of the object to secure them. A ship must move over the base of a Scan objective during it's activation before taking a secure action for the objective marker.
- **Recover**: A Recover objective is secured in the same way as a Scan objective, except that the ship cannot have performed an Advance action during it's activation. A recover objective is only scored at the end of the game if the ship that recovered it survives.
- **Destroy**: A Destroy objective is treated much the same as an enemy ship though it never activates and does not move. A Destroy objective is scored when it is destroyed. It has the following profile: Defence: 4+, Toughness: 4, Hit Points: 2.





## Building a Squadron

Players build their squadron by creating ships as outlined below. Each ship has a basic profile that is then enhanced by a number of upgrades. If you want to jump right into playing without designing your own ships you will find lists of premade ships, covering popular settings, on the [Squadrons Github Project Page](https://github.com/open-source-tabletop/squadrons).

Each ship starts at a cost of 15 points, with each upgrade and weapon adding to this total. Any ship with 5 or more upgrades adds 10 points and any ship with 7 or more adds 15 points. One ship should be designated as your Squadron Leader and gains the Squadron Leader special rule.

Games are best played at 300 - 400 points. Larger games may require a larger battlefield area.
