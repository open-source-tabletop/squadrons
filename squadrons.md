# Squadrons

Squadrons is a game of high speed combat between small fighter or bomber scale ships. Each player commands a squadron of around 5 to 15 ships as they try to take down their opponents ships.

### Playing Squadrons

Squadrons uses the Cadence Wargame System core rules, which can be found at [Cadence.Games](https://cadence.games).

Squadrons is best played on a 3ft x 3ft or similar sized area.

Each game of Squadrons lasts for 3 rounds, at the end of the 3rd round the players should roll a d6, on a roll of 3 or more there is also a 4th round.

Each model in Squadrons represents a single ship of fighter or bomber scale referred to throughout as **ships**. You may use any models you find appropriate so long as the scale and bases are consistent between players, though 1/270 scale is recommended.

### Ship Movement

#### Move Actions

Each time you activate one of your ships you must always take a Move action, though you may still choose when to perform this action. When you perform this action you must also move the maximum distance allowed and must moved in a straight line directly forward. When making a Move action you may make 1 pivot up to 45 degrees at any point during your movement.

#### Advance Actions

When you make an Advance action you follow the same rules as above for making a Move action. Alternatively you may instead move 2 inches forward and pivot your model exactly 180 degrees.

#### Moving over Bases

You may move over the bases of any friendly or enemy models during your movement so long as you have sufficient movement to complete the move without the bases overlapping. If you do not have sufficient movement your model stops before passing over the enemy base and your activation ends.

#### Evasion

When this model is targeted for an attack it may try to evade the attack if it still has Command Points remaining. This must be declared before any dice are rolled for the attack and the attacking player must give sufficient time for the player to declare they are evading. Spend one Command Point and move this model up to 2 inches directly to the left or right of its forward direction, stopping if it would overlap another model's base. This model may re-roll any failed Defence rolls from the attack that targetted it. 

### Ship Attacks

#### Targets

Ships may choose any ship as a target, even when they have enemy ships within 1 inch.

#### Line of Sight

Line of sight should be worked out for ships using only their bases, when looking through a model for line of sight the line is drawn from the base:

- If no line can be drawn between the attacking and targeted model's bases that intersects with obscuring terrain or another ship then the line of sight is clear.
- If lines can be drawn that do intersect but some clear lines can be drawn the line of sight is obscured.
- If no unobstructed lines can be drawn then the line of sight is blocked.

### Terrain

Terrain plays a limited roll in Squadrons and is not needed for every game, however it can add some interest to have some small items such as asteroids, debris, or other such items.

There are two types of terrain available in Squadrons: Obscuring and Dangerous. Models may move freely across this terrain with the following additional rules.

#### Obscuring

Models cannot make attacks that pass through Obscuring terrain.

#### Dangerous

Models that spend any part of their activation within Dangerous terrain must roll a d6, on a roll of a 1 they lose 1 hit point.

### Objectives

Squadrons has three types of objectives: **Scan**, **Recover**, and **Destroy**.

#### Scan

Scan objectives require a ship to make a close pass of the object to secure them. A ship must move over the base of a Scan objective during it's activation before taking a secure action for the objective marker.

#### Recover

A Recover objective is secured in the same way as a Scan objective, except that the ship cannot have performed an Advance action during it's activation. A recover objective is scored at the end of the game.

#### Destroy

A Destroy objective is treated much the same as an enemy ship, with Defence of 4+, Toughness and Hit Points of 2. A Destroy objective is scored when it is destroyed.

## Building a Squadron

Players build their squadron by creating ships as outlined below. Each ship has a basic profile that is then enhanced by a number of upgrades. There are some premade lists for popular settings listed at the end of this document.

Each ship starts at a cost of 15 points, with each upgrade and weapon adding to this total. Each ship with 5 or more upgrades starts at a cost of 23 points.

Games are best played at 150, 250, or 350 point limits.
